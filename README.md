# Colored-TicTacToe-Game-using-OOP

here is the some major section of my project:-

1) Initialize a 2D array to store the state of the game board.

2) Implement a function to display the game board.

3) Implement a function to handle user inputs and update the game board.

4) Implemnet logic to check for a win or a tie.

5) Put all the pieces together in the main function to run the game.
